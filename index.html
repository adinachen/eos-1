              A <strong><em>LITTLE</em></strong> step can make a <strong><em>BIG</em></strong> difference. From sharing news, to volunteering,
              to making donations: any step can bring us closer to our goal.</p>

            <p>We are six students at the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Intuit,
              and we made this as our final project to raise awareness for the pressing issues regarding our environment.
              Girls Who Code gave us all a wonderful opportunity to explore the computer science field.
              After all of our hard work, we hope you enjoyed looking at our site and will keep in mind that every little action counts in protecting our world.</p>
